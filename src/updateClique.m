%% this function is used in the clique selection part of the algorithm
% INPUT:
% clique: the current clique (a vector containing node indices)
% potentialNodes: list of nodes that can be added to the clique, so that it
% still remains a clique when one such node is added, a vector of node
% indices
% M: the graph, represented as an adjacency matrix

%OUTPUT:
% cl -> the new clique, after adding one of the nodes in the potentialNodes

function cl = updateClique(potentialNodes, clique, M)
